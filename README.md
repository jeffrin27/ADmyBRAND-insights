## AI Usage Report 
Throughout the development of ADmyBRAND Insights, I leveraged ChatGPT as my primary AI assistant to accelerate both technical and creative workflows. The AI helped across all phases of the project â€” from initial planning and folder structure to debugging Git errors and final deployment on Vercel.
In the early stages, ChatGPT assisted in brainstorming the dashboard layout and helped me design a modular, scalable UI architecture. It guided me in organizing reusable components like charts, cards, and tables using Next.js 14 and shadcn/ui, ensuring consistency in design and development.
During implementation, ChatGPT was instrumental in resolving issues related to chart integration, responsive design, and dark/light mode toggling. It also helped generate optimized snippets for rendering tables with sorting/filtering, managing UI animations, and improving overall user experience.
In the final phase, I used ChatGPT to configure Git, push code to GitHub, and deploy the project live using Vercel. It also supported me in writing a clear and professional README.md and maintaining best practices for open-source presentation.
Although I didnâ€™t use other tools like GitHub Copilot, v0.dev, or Cursor, this doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m limited to one AI workflow. Iâ€™m fully adaptable and open to integrating a wider range of AI tools in future projects to further boost productivity and code quality.
